# 4- Non technical situations

  ## Working in group
  * I was working with software upgrades for mobile
  * In the final software routine tests I discovered a massive issue when it was close to software deliver date
  * The code where the root cause was located was shared with other devices
  * I requested my other 5 Wi-Fi teammates to execute the same tests on all devices
  * It was necessary to list all devices capable of reproducing the issue
  * After list all devices with their help, I managed to integrate the fix for all devices before delivering
  * Without my teammate's help, probably some device upgrade delivery would be delayed
  
  ## Requesting help
  * I was developing a test tool to measure the location and GPS system performance
  * I manage to list the requirements to attend our tests and metrics
  * I asked my teammates to read the document and help to improve it
    * Tests procedure approaches
    * Some requirement that I forgot to list
    * Some feature that would help the team
  * After getting the first app version I created a shared bugs report spreadsheet
    * The team could make tests and find some bugs and suggest improvements as well
    * I cannot explore all tests scenarios for my self, always have some scenario left
    * The team filled the spreadsheet with many bugs reports and improvement suggestions
    * I become able to fix all bugs and make the app more robust
    * After some weeks of usage, I scheduled a quick meeting to discuss their suggestions
    * We reached consensus about what improvements suggestions was relevant and managed to order all by priority
    * I worked on the improvements and implementation according to the priorities

  ## Suggestion to improve team process
  * Location team had inefficient procedures
    * We used to use third parties applications to execute our tests
    * It was necessary to download and install multiple tools in order to attend all tests
  * Those tests was very repetitive
    * Same tests step for each device bringup
    * Repeat the test for every software change
  * In retrospective meeting I suggested to create our own app
    * All necessary tests
    * Automated tests
    * Team liked the suggestion
  * Leader requested a formal document
    * Tests to implement
    * Requirements
  * Document developed with all ideas
    * Requested teammates suggestions as well
    * Suggested to dedicate a single week day for work on this
  * Test app was success
    * Decreased test time from 20 minutes to only 2
    * The human interaction involved was only setup the test config
    * Location engineers become able to spend the time in other activities with the time saved
